# Project Description
This project was completed as a part of both the Global Health and the data science certificate capstone courses (GH-598-5 and DATA 555 respectively). Launching of this interactive dashboard and github repository satisfied the requirements for the completion of the Rollins School of Public Health Data Science certificate.

# Research Question

What are the main reasons why teens (aged 13-17) do not receive HPV shots across the 10 HHS region-NIS teen data in 2023?

# Problem statement
Despite the proven effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in explaining the prevalence of cervical cancer, its introduction cannot be targeted nationwide and is in addition to the many cancers that may be associated with HPV. There are issues that may challenge location, ethnicity/race, and economic status. Understanding the barriers to HPV vaccination and pinpointing ways to increase coverage, especially among underserved population, will help reduce the under representation of HPV-related conditions.

# Impact and importance

Addressing persistent gaps in HPV vaccination coverage requires targeted interventions to improve provider education, increase vaccine access, and address parental concerns and misinformation. Improving immunization infrastructure, especially in low-income and rural populations, is critical to ensuring equitable coverage of HPV vaccination. Furthermore, evidence-based public health interventions are needed to increase vaccine confidence and uptake.
